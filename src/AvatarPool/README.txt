Instructions for teachers who wish to create or update the course pool:

Go into the AvatarPool directory/folder (the folder this README is in)

All student avatar images must be named in the format of n.png where n is an integer ex: 0.png, 5.png, etc. Ensure there are no duplicate filenames.

default.png MUST EXIST. If you wish to update the default profile picture, remove the old one and ensure you replace it with a new default.png
